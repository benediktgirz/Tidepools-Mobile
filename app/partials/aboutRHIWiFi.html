  Red Hook WiFi is a community-led effort to close the digital divide, generate economic opportunity, facilitate access to essential services and improve quality of life in Red Hook, Brooklyn via the deployment of a wireless Internet network. It was created by a group of local young adults ages 19-24 called the Digital Stewards as part of a year-long job training program. 
  <br><br>
	Partnering with local businesses and residents to host nodes, Red Hook WiFi is looking to provide access to the Internet and resources such as education, housing, legal aid, and community events. Each time users sign on to the network, the splash page will alert them to local events and places of interest. 
	To learn more about hosting a node or joining the <a href="http://www.rhidigitalstewards.wordpress.com/">Digital Stewards program</a>, contact us at <a href="mailto:redhookwifi@rhicenter.org">redhookwifi@rhicenter.org</a>
